# Mission Junior Entreprise (Mines de Talents - MP d'Oc)

## Objective
The aim of the code is to develop the front-end of a website that references artisanal quarrying sites for supplying the lauze roofing and dry-stone building sectors.

## Point of Interest and Hover
When you click on a point of interest, it is enlarged, and its associated information appears. This is achieved using a style function defined in file 1 (line 278 to 285). The Hover function, implemented from line 289 to 313, displays the point in black when the mouse hovers over it.

## Dynamic cluster
When zooming out, the number of points in a region is displayed. By clicking on this number, the map zooms in on the region with the distributed points. Style functions are created to display the number of points within each cluster.

These features enable an interactive map experience based on the user's actions.
